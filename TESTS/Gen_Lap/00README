These  drivers  are for  testing  a  few methods  on  simple
(artificial) Laplacean matrix pairs (A, B).  

LapPLanR.c : 
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Polynomial Filter Lanczos with thick Restart
    make LapPLanR.ex --> executable LapPLanR.ex

LapPLanN.c :   
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Polynomial Filter non-restarting Lanczos 
    make LapPLanN.ex --> executable LapPLanN.ex

LapRLanR.c :  
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Rational Filter Lanczos with thick Restart
    make LapRLanR.ex --> executable LapRLanR.ex

LapRLanN.c :  
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Rational Filter non-restart Lanczos 
    make LapRLanN.ex --> executable LapRLanN.ex

To compute  all the  eigenvalues of  a Laplacian  pair (A,  B) located
inside [1.5, 2.5], where A is discretized on an N1*N2*N3 grid and B is
discretized on an (N1*N2*N3)*1*1 grid with four slices:
