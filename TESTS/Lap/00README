These  drivers  are for testing a few methods on simple
Laplacean matrices.   

LapPLanR.c : 
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Polynomial Filter Lanczos with thick Restart
    make LapPLanR.ex --> executable LapPLanR.ex

LapPLanN.c :   
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Polynomial Filter non-restarting Lanczos 
    make LapPLanN.ex --> executable LapPLanN.ex

LapPSI.c : 
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Polynomial Filter Subspace Iteration
    make LapPSI.ex --> executable LapPSI.ex

LapRLanR.c :  
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Rational Filter Lanczos with thick Restart
    make LapRLanR.ex --> executable LapRLanR.ex

LapRLanN.c :  
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Rational Filter non-restart Lanczos 
    make LapRLanN.ex --> executable LapRLanN.ex

LapPLanN_MatFree.c :  
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Polynomial Filter non-restart Lanczos
    [This example is to illustrate the use of Matrix-free solvers]
    make LapPLanN_MatFree.ex --> executable LapPLanN_MatFree.ex

To compute all the eigenvalues of a Laplacian discretized on
an N1*N2*N3  grid, located in  the interval [D1, D2]  with K
slices:

./Lap*.ex -nx N1 -ny N2 -nz N3 -a D1 -b D2 -nslices K
