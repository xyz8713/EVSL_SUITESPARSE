This  directory  contains  drivers  for testing  a  few  routines  for
computing eigenvalues  of general sparse (symmetric  real) matrix pair
(A, B), where B has to  be positive definite.  These matrices are read
from a file  in the matrix market format.  Uses Lanczo's algorthim for
DOS. Note:  The HB matrix format is not supported.

For  the rational  filter driver  you will  need to  link to
various modules  from the  SuiteSparse package.

io.c    : functions - in particular for reading matrices in mm format
mmio.c  : support functions for mm format [not all are needed] 

The computed eigenvalues are saved in OUT/ folder. 
 
Run:
